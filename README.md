# ImageClassification_RICEDATASET
This project aims to develop an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically identify different varieties of rice grains from their images. The model is trained on the Rice Image Dataset, which contains high-resolution images of various rice types, including Basmati, Jasmine, Karacadag, and others.

The main goal is to create a deep learning model that can accurately classify rice varieties by analyzing visual features such as shape, texture, and size. This approach can help automate rice grain inspection in agricultural and industrial settings, reducing the need for manual classification and improving efficiency.

The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and dense layers to perform final classification. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, with options to use PyTorch as an alternative framework. The training process includes image preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve performance and generalization.

The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix are used to assess model performance. The final model achieves a test accuracy of around 98%, showing high effectiveness in distinguishing between rice varieties.
